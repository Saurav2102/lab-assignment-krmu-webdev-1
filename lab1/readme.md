This project is a one-page portfolio website built using semantic HTML5 tags like 'header', 'nav', 'section', and 'footer'. It includes a hero section with a title and short introduction, an About section with a profile image and alt text, and Projects listed using 'ul' or 'article' elements. A Skills table presents key technical tools, while a Contact form (with name, email, and message fields) ensures usability through proper labels, placeholders, and required attributes. Internal navigation links allow smooth scrolling between sections, and a “Skip to main content” link improves accessibility. The code is structured cleanly for easy CSS styling and future enhancements.
If you want to use my code, you simply can just replace my name with your name in the entire code and replace my portfolio-picture with your picture.
